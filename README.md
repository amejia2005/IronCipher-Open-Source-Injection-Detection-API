## üöÄ About the Project
IronCipher is a cybersecurity-focused web application designed to detect and mitigate common injection attacks as well as malicious file uploads.

Key features include:
- **Injection Detection:** Identifies SQL, XML, JS, HTML, and CSS injections from user-submitted text inputs.
- **File Analysis:** Scans uploaded images and PDFs for embedded malicious code.
- **OAuth2 Integration:** Protects endpoints and ensures secure user authentication.
- **Threat Flagging:** Backend logic prioritizes suspicious requests for further analysis.
- **Request Security:** Limits repeated requests from the same IP and requires a **request code** on each POST request to ensure safe interactions.

The project was built with **Django** and integrates both real-time input validation and file inspection capabilities to provide early-stage threat detection.
